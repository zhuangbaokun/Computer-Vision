In this tutorial, you will learn how to classify images of cats and dogs by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network.

A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. You either use the pretrained model as is or use transfer learning to customize this model to a given task.

The intuition behind transfer learning for image classification is that if a model is trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. You can then take advantage of these learned feature maps without having to start from scratch by training a large model on a large dataset.

In this notebook, you will try two ways to customize a pretrained model:

1. Feature Extraction: Use the representations learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. You simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that you can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for the dataset.

 You do not need to (re)train the entire model. The base convolutional network already contains features that are generically useful for classifying pictures. However, the final, classification part of the pretrained model is specific to the original classification task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained.

1. Fine-Tuning: Unfreeze a few of the top layers of a frozen model base and jointly train both the newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This allows us to "fine-tune" the higher-order feature representations in the base model in order to make them more relevant for the specific task.

You will follow the general machine learning workflow.

1. Examine and understand the data
1. Build an input pipeline, in this case using Keras ImageDataGenerator
1. Compose the model
   * Load in the pretrained base model (and pretrained weights)
   * Stack the classification layers on top
1. Train the model
1. Evaluate model

## Create the base model from the pre-trained convnets
You will create the base model from the **MobileNet V2** model developed at Google. This is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large dataset consisting of 1.4M images and 1000 classes. ImageNet is a research training dataset with a wide variety of categories like `jackfruit` and `syringe`. This base of knowledge will help us classify cats and dogs from our specific dataset.

First, you need to pick which layer of MobileNet V2 you will use for feature extraction. The very last classification layer (on "top", as most diagrams of machine learning models go from bottom to top) is not very useful.  Instead, you will follow the common practice to depend on the very last layer before the flatten operation. This layer is called the "bottleneck layer". The bottleneck layer features retain more generality as compared to the final/top layer.

First, instantiate a MobileNet V2 model pre-loaded with weights trained on ImageNet. By specifying the **include_top=False** argument, you load a network that doesn't include the classification layers at the top, which is ideal for feature extraction.

### Freeze the convolutional base

It is important to freeze the convolutional base before you compile and train the model. Freezing (by setting layer.trainable = False) prevents the weights in a given layer from being updated during training. MobileNet V2 has many layers, so setting the entire model's `trainable` flag to False will freeze all of them.

Many models contain `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` layers. This layer is a special case and precautions should be taken in the context of fine-tuning, as shown later in this tutorial. 

When you set `layer.trainable = False`, the `BatchNormalization` layer will run in inference mode, and will not update its mean and variance statistics. 

When you unfreeze a model that contains BatchNormalization layers in order to do fine-tuning, you should keep the BatchNormalization layers in inference mode by passing `training = False` when calling the base model. Otherwise, the updates applied to the non-trainable weights will destroy what the model has learned.

"""Note: If you are wondering why the validation metrics are clearly better than the training metrics, the main factor is because layers like `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` and `tf.keras.layers.Dropout` affect accuracy during training. They are turned off when calculating validation loss.

To a lesser extent, it is also because training metrics report the average for an epoch, while validation metrics are evaluated after the epoch, so validation metrics see a model that has trained slightly longer.

## Fine tuning
In the feature extraction experiment, you were only training a few layers on top of an MobileNet V2 base model. The weights of the pre-trained network were **not** updated during training.

One way to increase performance even further is to train (or "fine-tune") the weights of the top layers of the pre-trained model alongside the training of the classifier you added. The training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic feature maps to features associated specifically with the dataset.

Note: This should only be attempted after you have trained the top-level classifier with the pre-trained model set to non-trainable. If you add a randomly initialized classifier on top of a pre-trained model and attempt to train all layers jointly, the magnitude of the gradient updates will be too large (due to the random weights from the classifier) and your pre-trained model will forget what it has learned.

Also, you should try to fine-tune a small number of top layers rather than the whole MobileNet model. In most convolutional networks, the higher up a layer is, the more specialized it is. The first few layers learn very simple and generic features that generalize to almost all types of images. As you go higher up, the features are increasingly more specific to the dataset on which the model was trained. The goal of fine-tuning is to adapt these specialized features to work with the new dataset, rather than overwrite the generic learning.

### Un-freeze the top layers of the model

All you need to do is unfreeze the `base_model` and set the bottom layers to be un-trainable. Then, you should recompile the model (necessary for these changes to take effect), and resume training.

"""## Summary

* **Using a pre-trained model for feature extraction**:  When working with a small dataset, it is a common practice to take advantage of features learned by a model trained on a larger dataset in the same domain. This is done by instantiating the pre-trained model and adding a fully-connected classifier on top. The pre-trained model is "frozen" and only the weights of the classifier get updated during training.
In this case, the convolutional base extracted all the features associated with each image and you just trained a classifier that determines the image class given that set of extracted features.

* **Fine-tuning a pre-trained model**: To further improve performance, one might want to repurpose the top-level layers of the pre-trained models to the new dataset via fine-tuning.
In this case, you tuned your weights such that your model learned high-level features specific to the dataset. This technique is usually recommended when the training dataset is large and very similar to the original dataset that the pre-trained model was trained on.
